# Launcher
A simple launcher for Windows applications, Windows services and batch (.bat) scripts.

> ⚠️ Although developed in .Net 6, this solution (both library and app) is Windows only.

## The solution contains 2 projects:
* **Launcher.Core**: a library that allows you to start, monitor and stop Windows applications, Windows services and batch scritps.
* **Launcher**: a Windows Forms application that provides a simple user interface for configuration and use of the Launcher.Core utilities. You may use this project or just look at its source code to search for examples on how to use the Launcher.Core library in your own projects.
